# sample-playlist-generator
This is a project to generate a Spotify playlist with a few sample songs of a given artist.

Have you ever seen a supporting band for a concert you're going to, and wondered what they sounded like? Has anybody ever given you a list of bands you should listen to? It's easy enough to go to a band's Spotify page and check out their most popular songs, but that can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, because you have to search for each artist individually. With this app, you can enter a comma-separated list of artists, and the system will generate a playlist with 2-3 of each artist's most popular songs.

Happy listening!
